# Book Shop Project
---

This project was designed to organize the Book, Dvd and Magazine information sold in a book store. However, it does 
not use any database structure or text file to store information. I want to make the necessary improvements and make it a 
more meaningful project.

I did this project as homework when I was in the early days of college. I will organize and try to improve it whenever 
I find the opportunity. n this way, I will both evaluate my old projects and try to see if there are any mistakes 
I made in the past. In addition, I will mention the places where I made improvements in notes here. I also plan to 
put the improvements I want to make here in a checklist.

### To Do List

- [x] I will edit the names of variables and functions for readability.
- [x] I will add comment lines that explain the purpose of the functions.
- [x] I will remove unnecessary variables and functions.
- [ ] I will catch errors that could cause the program to crash and take precautions.
- [ ] When the program is terminated, I will establish a database or text file link to store the entered information.
